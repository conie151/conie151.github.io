# Introduction to Network Analysis
_1. Network Devices_

_What is a Router?_ 
A network device that (requests and?) forwards (requested) data, such as a search query ("google.com") based on a (logical) address - [On TCP/IP networks router uses IP address]

_What is a Hub?_
A network device that connects all devices on a LAN. When a system sends data to the hub on one port,the hub broadcasts the data to all other attached data, not understanding who the intended recipient of data. This generates uneesecessary traffic, which can allow connecteed attackers to steal data

_What is a Switch?_
A version of a Hub that understands where to send data Using MAC addresses as unique identifiers for recipients of incoming data. 

_What is a Network Bridge?_
A bridge connects separate networks to turn them into a larger network. Although the networks are connected, they can still work independently (In the OSI model, bridging works at layer 2, the Data Link layer.

_What is a Firewall?_
A network device (can be hardware or software) providing fundamental network security, monitoring incoming and outcoming traffic and determining whether to allow or block it based on rules.

_2. Ports and Services_
