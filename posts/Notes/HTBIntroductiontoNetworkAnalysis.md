# Introduction to Network Analysis
_1. Network Devices_

_What is a Router?_ A network device that (requests and?) forwards (requested) data, such as a search query ("google.com") based on a (logical) address - [On TCP/IP networks router uses IP address]

_What is a Hub?_ A network device that connects all devices on a LAN. When a system sends data to the hub on one port,the hub broadcasts the data to all other attached data, not understanding who the intended recipient of data. This generates uneesecessary traffic, which can allow connecteed attackers to steal data
