# Notes

What is Microsoft Azure?: 
A cloud computing platform with services to help the user meet business goals, including web hosting in the cloud, the ability to run VC's (Virtual Computers), cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, centralized account management; and AI and Internet of Things (IoT) - focused services

What is Cloud Computing?:
The delivery of computing services over the internet
  Common Computing services: 
  - IT Infrastructure (VM's, Storage, databases, networking)
  - Traditional IT Offerings (Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence)

Why is the cloud better compared to traditional Infrastructure?:
Since cloud computing uses the internet to deliver their services, you (the user) can use the cloud to rapidly increase your IT Infrastructure, instead of having to wait for another physical datacenter to be built. Additionally, you only pay for what you use (what you need).
