  1.1 Understanding Cybersecurity
  
_What is Cybersecurity?_ :
Cybersecurity is the _practice of protecting systems, networks, and digital assets from malicious attacks¹, unauthorized access, and data breaches. 

¹ _What Malicious attacks are we referring to?:_
Intrusion: Imagine your computer system is a fortress - with high walls, a moat, and a secure gate. Inside the Fortress, there's valuable treasure (sensitive data, personal information, and more). An "Intrusion" is like an unwanted visitor attempting to breach the fortress walls and gain access to your treasure. 

_How can an "intruder" get past the gameras, guards, and walls of my castle?_:
Virus: The _sneaky_ infiltrator → The _Virus_ is a _Spy_ who infiltrates the castle _disguised as a trusted messenger_

> **_A Computer Virus_** is a piece of code that attaches itself to a legitimate program/file. When you run the _infected_ program, the virus activates and spreads, like a disguised messenger spreading chaos within the castle.

Trojan Horse: The _Deceptive_ Gift → The _Trojan Horse_ is a _Seemingly innocent gift_ left at the castle gates by an _unknown source._

>**_A Trojan Horse_** is Malware disguised as a legitimate file or program. Like the legendary wooden horse to infitrate Troy, it tricks the user into installing it, giving unauthorized access to the attacker. The Deceptive package carries a hidden threat.
