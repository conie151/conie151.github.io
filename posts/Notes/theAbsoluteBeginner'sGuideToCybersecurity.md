  1.1 Understanding Cybersecurity
  
_What is Cybersecurity?_ :
Cybersecurity is the practice of _protecting systems, networks, and digital assets from malicious attacks¹, unauthorized access, and data breaches_. 

(_CISCO Introduction to Cybersecurity - What Is Cybersecurity?_
Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.)

¹ _What Malicious attacks are we referring to?:_
Intrusion: Imagine your computer system is a fortress - with high walls, a moat, and a secure gate. Inside the Fortress, there's valuable treasure (sensitive data, personal information, and more). An "Intrusion" is like an unwanted visitor attempting to breach the fortress walls and gain access to your treasure. 

_How can an "intruder" get past the gameras, guards, and walls of my castle?_:

Virus: The _sneaky_ infiltrator → The _Virus_ is a _Spy_ who infiltrates the castle _disguised as a trusted messenger_

> **_A Computer Virus_** is a piece of code that attaches itself to a legitimate program/file. When you run the _infected_ program, the virus activates and spreads, like a disguised messenger spreading chaos within the castle.

Trojan Horse: The _Deceptive_ Gift → The _Trojan Horse_ is a _Seemingly innocent gift_ left at the castle gates by an _unknown source._

>**_A Trojan Horse_** is Malware disguised as a legitimate file or program. Like the legendary wooden horse to infitrate Troy, it tricks the user into installing it, giving unauthorized access to the attacker. The Deceptive package carries a hidden threat.

Worm: The Secret _Tunnel_ Digger → The _Worm_ is a _sneaky_ creature that _digs_ secret tunnels _connecting different parts of the castle._

>**_A Computer Worm_** is a _standalone_ program that replicates itself to spread accross the network. It _doesn't need a host file_ to attach to - Just like secret tunnel systems don't rely on existing structures. Works can _rapidly spread through interconnected systems_, like tunnels weaving through the castle's different sections.

**Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of technologies, Processes, and practices designed to safegaurd our digital world.**

## The Threat Landscape in Cybersecurity
_The field of cybersecurity has witnessed significant changes in the nature of threats over the years. Understanding this evolution helps us develop effective strategies to protect agains current and future cyberthreats._

A Historical Perspective:
1. A Background on Viruses and Worms (1980's - 1990's):
- Early viruses were primarily transmitted via infected floppy disks, which were commonly used for software distribution.
  
**Morris Worm: A Pioneering Incident (1988)**:
  The Morris worm, created by Robert Tappan Morris, was unleashed on the internet on November 2, 1988, intended to gauge the size of the internet.
  
  Significance:
  
  _↳Exploited vulnerabilities in Unix-Based systems, primarily "Sendmail" (an older "email,") "Finger (a sort of online yellow pages with public personal information), and weak passwork mechanisms._
  
  _↳Implemented a self-replicating mechanism, allowing it to propagate accross connected systems._
  
★ The Worm spread _faster_ than anticipated, causing system shutdowns and, in some cases, complete unavailability (a total of ~6,000 systems.)

★ Morris' experiment highlighted the unpredictability of malware behaviour and the potential for unintended consequences. 

★ The Incident underscored the need for ethical handling of security research and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

★ In 1989, Morris became the _first person to be tried and convicted unter the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)_ in the United States.

★ The Incident raised awareness about the vulnerability of connected systems and the potential for rapid, self-propagating malware. It also prompted the development + enhancement of security practices.

>**_Another Significant case convicted Under the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act (CFAA)_**
> Kevin Mitnick (1999)
> - In 1979, at 16, Kevin Broke into the Digital Equipment Corporations (DEC) computer network and copid the company's software → he was sentenced to 12 months of prison + 3 years of supervised release.
> - Near the end of his supervised release, he hacked into Pacific Bell voicemail computers → he fled, becoming a fugitive for 2 1/2 years.
> - Kevin Had allegedly gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks as a fugitive. He _intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke and read private emails.
> - Mitnick was finnaly arrested on February 15, 1996
> - Case Significance: The case became a landmark in the legal landscape of computer crimes, bringing attention to the need for legislation to address computer crimes. It also demonstrated that hacking and unauthorized access to computer networks could be treated as serious criminal offenses.
> - In 2001, Kevin Mitnick wrote a book, **"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security"** (my favorite book to read of his:

>**_Key Takeaway:_**
> - Social Engineering: The art of Manipulating, Influencing, or decieving people in order to gain unauthorized access to information or systems (targeting the _human element._)
> - Mitnick emphasized the ease of gaining access to private services both physically and online by tricking people into willingly or unknowingly give the nescessary information away. Tricks include exploiting the human curiousity for phishing or spamming, exploiting Authority and COmpliance to pose as someone with a high respect due, and taking advantage of company privacy blunders, such as picking up sensitive information unproperly discarded outside large company facilities.

### From CISCO Introduction to Cybersecurity Course

_What do cybercrmiinals want from me?_
Cybercriminals can use your sensitive personal information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.

- Every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security.
