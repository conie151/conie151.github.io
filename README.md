## Documentaries

In this section, you will find notes on my favorite documentaries related to cybersecurity, upcoming technologies, and cryptocurrency. I believe that visual media can be a powerful tool for learning, and I'm excited to share my insights from these documentaries.

## Notes

As I progress in my cybersecurity journey, I actively engage in Microsoft lessons and work towards certifications. To enhance my understanding and contribute to the community, I re-study and rewrite my notes in a digital format. This not only solidifies my comprehension but also provides a resource for others on a similar learning path.


Happy coding and learning!
